# Sales Management System
This project is a sales system that manages the sale of products through a software architecture that includes a database, where all the necessary tables are stored. It uses ASP.NET Core Web API for the implementation of its API, structured in layers that include business logic (BLL), data access (DAL), models (Model), and utilities (Utility). The system allows to perform CRUD operations on products and sales, manage users and roles, and generate sales reports, all through a friendly and accessible user interface. In addition, dependency injection is implemented to facilitate scalability and code maintenance.
